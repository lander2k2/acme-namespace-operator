# Acme Namespace Operator

A reference implementation of a Kubernetes operator used to manage namespaces
and associated resources.

This is a complete codebase for an example provided in chapter 11 of the book
[Production
Kubernetes](https://www.amazon.com/Production-Kubernetes-Successful-Application-Platforms/dp/1492092304/).

Note: this is not a production-ready operator.  It is complete in that it works
as intended, but it takes some shortcuts.

Versions 1.15 of Golang and 2.3.2 of Kubebuilder were used to build this codebase.
